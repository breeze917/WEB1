        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a
            high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
            and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS,
            JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web
            content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and
            provide online programs, including video games. The majority of
            websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without
            the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each
            of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation
            of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some
            engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines
            supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
