            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web
            pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language
            can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and
            XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.
            Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used
            by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user
            interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile
            applications.
